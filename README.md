EMERGENCY DENTAL PROBLEMS
Dental emergencies are surprisingly common, and being prepared to handle them can help preserve your teeth. Below you’ll find preventative measures and how to handle an unexpected dental emergency.


Safeguards
When you’re involved in physical activities and sports, wear a mouthguard. Did you know that the Dublin Metro Dental team can fit you with a custom mouthguard for much better protection? Be very careful that you’re protecting your teeth from avoidable chipping and enamel damage as well- never use your teeth as a tool or chew on very hard objects.


Handling Common Emergencies
· If you’re experiencing a toothache, rinse your mouth and use dental floss to clear any food particles.

· If you injure a tooth, rinse your mouth and apply ice packs to your face to reduce swelling.

· If an adult tooth comes out, try putting it back in place or in some cold liquid such as milk, then call our practice immediately. Dublin Metro Dental offers 24 hour emergency dental care, so don’t delay in calling us!

If you have a dental emergency, it’s crucial to call your Dublin Ohio Dentist soon as possible so we can get you in and take care of it. Don’t suffer with mouth pain- come in and see our team so we can get you treatment immediately.
